## Overview

TranspareNC is a blockchain-based donation platform designed to bring transparency, accountability, and trust to the donation process. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that every contribution is securely recorded and traceable, giving donors complete confidence that their funds reach the right beneficiaries.

## Problem Statement

- Lack of transparency and accountability in traditional donation systems creates trust issues, making donors hesitant to contribute.
- No unified platform effectively leverages modern technology to seamlessly track donations and ensure funds are utilized properly.

## Our Solution

TranspareNC provides a decentralized, immutable, and real-time donation tracking system that:
1. Ensures complete transparency for donors.
2. Verifies transactions and fund utilization using blockchain.
3. Prevents fraud and misuse of donations.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js 
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Solidity, Smart Contracts
- **Authentication:** Web3, MetaMask

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   https://github.com/lavanayakhosla/Ethereum-Donation-Platform.git
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
Prerequisite for making payments.
1) MetaMask Chrome Extension
Install the MetaMask extension from the official website https://metamask.io/download/.
Create a MetaMask wallet account if you don't already have one.

2) Sepolia Test Network
Add the Sepolia Testnet to your MetaMask wallet:
Click on the network dropdown in MetaMask.
Select “Add Network” and choose Sepolia from the list or configure it manually if not available.
Make sure you have some test ETH in your Sepolia wallet. You can get test ETH from a Sepolia faucet  https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia.

## How It Works

1. **Donors** make a contribution using the platform.
2. **Blockchain records** the transaction immutably.
3. **NGOs & verified organizations** receive and utilize the funds.

## Challenges Faced During Implementation

- **Ensuring a balance between transparency and donor privacy.**
- **Complying with global financial regulations.**
- **Optimizing gas fees for blockchain transactions.**

## Future Scope

- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, etc.).
- AI-powered fraud detection to prevent scams.
- Mobile app for easy access.
- Community-driven governance for decision-making.
